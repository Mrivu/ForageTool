Submission for HY-TKT20019

This application is an addition to my D&D campaign, which allows players to search, discover and manage plants.

- Admin users can add plant packages, which update the available plants for all users.
- Users are required to log in due to the existence of an admin account and database information.
- Users can view and sort all acquired plants.
- Found plants can be deleted or turned into potions.
- Users can search for individual plants by name.
- The application displays statistics on found plants.
- Found plants can be sorted into different "Folders"
- Users can create notes on found plants.
